        <h3>Timeline of Turing's Life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London, England</li>
            <li><strong>1926</strong> - Turing spent much of his life separated from his parents as they worked abroad. He was enrolled to the Sherborne School at 13 and was given an intellectually rigid education, prompting him to learn more advanced ideas on his own. </li>
            <li><strong>1930</strong> - Turing became intensely attracted to another student, Christopher Morcom, who suddenly died of tuberculosis. Morcom's influence caused Turing to communicate more and become an academic success. After Morcom's death, Turing grew interested with the problems of the human mind.</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Turing won a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, and took the Mathematics degree with distinction. He was on track for a distinguished career in pure mathematics.</li>
            <li><strong>1936</strong> - Turing publishes a paper that is now recognised as the foundation of computer science. The paper analysed what it meant for a human to follow a definite method or procedure to perform a task, inventing the idea of a 'Universal Machine' that could decode and perform any set of instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>1939</strong> - Turing returns to Britain after two years at Princeton to join the government's code-breaking department. Joined by other mathematicians at Bletchley Park, Turing rapidly develops a new machine (the 'Bombe') capable of breaking German Enigma messages on an industrial scale.</li>
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - Turing finds a close friendship with another mathematician, Joan Clarke. Turing proposes to her, but then tell her of his homosexuality. The engagement soon dies.</li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - Turing works on other technical innovations during the war. In particular, he helped build a system to encrypt and decrypt spoken telephone conversations. He later takes on a position at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).</li>
            <li><strong>1946</strong> - Turing produces a detailed design for the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), a precursor to the modern computer that stores programs in its memory. However, Turing leaves the NPL in 1948 and never sees production of the pilot version of ACE in 1950.</li>
            <li><strong>1950</strong> -Turing moves to the University of Manchester and continues his work on computing. He publishes a philosophical paper on artificial intelligence and explains what is now called the Turing Test.</li>
            <li><strong>1951</strong> - Turing begins working on problems of mathematical biology. More specially, he uses the Manchester computer to understand the biological patterns - spots, stripes, flower petals - of nature. He is also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for his earlier work.</li>
            <li><strong>1952</strong> - Turing was convicted for having an affair with a young man. Homosexual activity was illegal until 1967, so Turing, rather than accepting a prison sentence, accepted probation on the condition of accepting hormonal treatment (i.e. chemical castration). He was also banned from further work with the government code-breaking department.</li>
            <li><strong>1954</strong> - During Turing's last years, he was constantly harassed by police surveillance. On June 8, 1954, he was found dead from cyanide poisoning. His mother believed that he accidentally ingested cyanide from an amateur chemistry experiment, but Turing most likely planned his death.</li>
            <li><strong>2013</strong> - Turing is granted a posthumous royal pardon, formally cancelling his criminal conviction. The campaign for his pardon was supported by tens of thousands of people.</li>
        </ul>
